            <h2>Time to Explore</h2>
            <p>Below we're going to take a look into some interesting facts scientist have discovered about the ocean.</p>

            <h3>Did you Know?</h3>
            <img src="images/oceans.jpg" alt="Oceans">
            <p>Over 70% of the earth surface is covered in water, and those who explore the mysteries of these waters are called "oceanaunt." Today you become one of these explorers, and while many may be familiar with the phrase "The Seven Seas" it's really impossible to make any division as its all one vast body.</p>

            <h3>It Glows!</h3>
            <img src="images/bio.jpg" alt="Bio">
            <p>Many sea plants and animals are bioluminescent, which means they produce light chemically within their bodies. This is actually for serveral reasons: fending off predators, luring prey, and attracting mates. Usually this charactistic is seen in marine animals where this is considered the only source of light. With the exception of the platypus.</p>

            <p>The ocean is full of a vast variety of life; from the smallest clam to the largest whale. Reptiles such as the sea turtle, spend their live wondering around these waters until they eventually find themselves on a sandy beach to lay their eggs. The clown fish, although small, is fiesty and partners with the sea anemone. This relationship benefits both as the clownfish finds shelter and the sea anemone is provided with food. Lastly, there's the cuttlefish, a relative of the octopus and squid that can produce between 100 and 300 eggs. There's still so much left to discover and scientist are working around the clock to learn as much as we can about these waters.</p>

                    <p>Scientist have only explored 5% of the ocean; meaning there's so much more to discover! Together, let's dive deeper into some more interesting facts about the waters and the creatures living in them.
