            <h2>Time to Explore</h2>
            <p>Below we're going to take a look into some interesting facts scientist have discovered about the ocean.</p>

            <h3>Did you Know?</h3>
            <img src="images/oceans.jpg" alt="Oceans">
            <p>Over 70% of the earth surface is covered in water, and those who explore the mysteries of these waters are called "oceanaunt." Today you become one of these explorers, and while many may be familiar with the phrase "The Seven Seas" it's really impossible to make any division as its all one vast body.</p>

            <h3>It Glows!</h3>
            <img src="images/bio.jpg" alt="Bio">
            <p>Many sea plants and animals are bioluminescent, which means they produce light chemically within their bodies. This is actually for serveral reasons: fending off predators, luring prey, and attracting mates. Usually this charactistic is seen in marine animals where this is considered the only source of light. With the exception of the platypus.</p>

            <h3>Meet the Neighbors</h3>
            <img src="images/julia.png" alt="Julia">
            <p>Julia was recorded on March 1, 1999 by the U.S NOAA. Again, NOAA claims the source to be most likely a large iceberg that had run aground off Anartica. The sound was loud enough to be heard over the entire Equatorial Pacific Ocean autonomous hydrophone array with it lasting for 2 minutes and 43 seconds. Despite this, NOAA was unable to pin-point where the sound was coming from only narrowing it to between Bransfield Straits and Cape Afare. There are many who believe this to be the call of an undiscovered species, as humanity has still yet to discover much of our oceans. For now, however, these sounds remain a mystery and scientist can only guess as to what the origin is.</p>

                    <p>Scientist have only explored 5% of the ocean; meaning there's so much more to discover! Together, let's dive deeper into some more interesting facts about the waters and the creatures living in them. On our Extra page you'll find fun facts about the oceans strangest little creatures, and how these waters can be dangerous.</p>
