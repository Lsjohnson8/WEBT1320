            <h3>How Sound Travels in Water and How We Catch It</h3>
            <p>In water, sound waves travel 4.3x faster and longer distances; humans have naturally adapted to pick up sound waves that travel through air, but once we're underwater everything seems muffled and quiet. Inorder to hear the music that the ocean offers, Reginald Fessenden invented the Hydrophone in 1914. This underwater device picks up sounds waves from all directions and converts them into electric signals, similar to a microphone. The ocean is, naturally, a noisy place with storms, earthquakes, and animals. With the rise of the industrial age, there was also an increase in noise from human activies: ships, sonar, and drilling. Every sound varies, such as how loud they are (intensity, measured in decibles), how long they last (fractions of a second to never ending), and their pitch or tone (frequency, measured in hertz). While there are many natural and familiar sounds all over the ocean, there have been recorded instances of noises that are not so comforting. Scientist have come up with many expanations for these "out of the ordinary" noises such as: large icebergs breaking or scraping along the ocean floor, or underwater volcanoes. However, many still speculate that these could be the result of an undiscovered species waiting in the depths. For more information, click the "More" link at the top of the page.</p>
