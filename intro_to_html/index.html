    <h1>Deep Sea Sharks</h1>

    <h2>The Greenland Shark</h2>
    <p>The Greenland Shark is considered one of the largest species of shark, and longest living with a life expectancy of 400 years. They can grow up to 20 ft (6.4 m), and reside in the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans. Inorder to survive in such a harsh climate, the Greenland shark has evolved to have certain adaptations such as: high levels of chemical compounds that act like antifreeze and prevent ice crystals forming in the body, slow metabolism and thick layers of fat, as well as dark skin. The Greenland Shark is an opportunistic feeder, and has a diverse diet of: fish, marine mammals, squid, crabs, other sharks, eels, and dead animals. Although, with its small eyes and being blind, it must rely on its sense of smell to hunt. Interestingly, they manage to discourage predators with their meat which is toxic and requires being fermented or boiled inorder to be consumed. The Greenland shark is considered a vulnerable species, meaning they are at risk for extinction. They are vulnerable to activities such as fishing and whaling, and were hunted for their liver oil which was used for machine oil.</p>

    <h2>The Frilled Shark</h2>
    <p>The Frilled Shark, discovered in the 19th century, is known for its eel-like appearance. It has large gills and a flexible spin which allows it to thrive in its deep-sea habitat, and resist the enormous water pressure. The Frilled Sharks specialized jaw is filled with sharp recurved teeth that prevent escape. It is unknown how long they live but it is estimated to be 25 years with a length of about 4-6 ft (1.3-2 m). They are found in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, primarily on the continental shelf and the deeper continental slope. Its diet mainly consists of various species of squid, smaller bonefish, and smaller shark species. The Frilled Shark is an ambush predator, using speed to close the distance between it and its prey. When hunting food, it curls its tail against a rock and moves like an eel. It uses its flexible body to bend and quickly lunge at prey.</p>
