    <h2>The Greenland Shark</h2>
    <p>The Greenland Shark is considered one of the largest species of shark, and longest living with a life expectancy of 400 years. They can grow up to 20 ft (6.4 m), and reside in the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans. Inorder to survive in such a harsh climate, the Greenland shark has evolved to have certain adaptations such as: high levels of chemical compounds that act like antifreeze and prevent ice crystals forming in the body, slow metabolism and thick layers of fat, as well as dark skin. The Greenland Shark is an opportunistic feeder, and has a diverse diet of: fish, marine mammals, squid, crabs, other sharks, eels, and dead animals. Although, with its small eyes and being blind, it must rely on its sense of smell to hunt. Interestingly, they manage to discourage predators with their meat which is toxic and requires being fermented or boiled inorder to be consumed. The Greenland shark is considered a vulnerable species, meaning they are at risk for extinction. They are vulnerable to activities such as fishing and whaling, and were hunted for their liver oil which was used for machine oil.</p>
